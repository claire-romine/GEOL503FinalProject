# GEOL503FinalProject
Final Project for GEOL 503 (Spring 2024) over REE abundances in Kilauea lava vs. Chondrite.

This repository contains the final project for GEOL 503 Spring 2024. I'm comparing the REE abundances in Kilauea lava and a Chondrite with data from J.M. Rhodes lecture at UMass. I'm plotting and observing the trends and correlation between the two.
